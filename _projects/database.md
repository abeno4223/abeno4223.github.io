## Overview

These projects are associated with the design and manipulation of databases in SQL.

## Movie Rental Database

In this project, a fictional Movie Rental Store is seeking to extract information from its pre-existing database of Movie Rentals in order to improve its sales. To assist and provide comprehensive data analysis, detailed and summary tables were created using PostgreSQL code. The summarized information displays the most popular actors among customers, allowing staff to place movies featuring those actors prominently at the front of the store in order to get more rentals.
